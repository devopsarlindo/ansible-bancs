----------------------------------------------------------------------------------The TCS BaNCSMI installer you are attempting to run seems to have a copy already
running.

This could be from a previous failed installation attempt or you may have
accidentally launched
the installer twice. The recommended action is to select 'No' and wait for the
other copy of
the installer to start. If you are sure there is no other copy of the installer
running, click
the 'Yes' button to allow this installer to run.

Are you sure you want to continue with this installation?
